  description: 'February 20, 1866. Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian monk, publishes his paper, “Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden” (“Experiments on Plant Hybridization”), containing his findings on heredity in the journal Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brunn. These findings, which demonstrate that inheritance follows particular laws, emerged from years of observations breeding pea plants at the experimental garden of the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno. Mendel’s work show that certain traits are dominant or recessive and how the combination thereof produces observable variations to characteristics such as flower colour or the texture of a seed. His work went largely unremarked for 35 years following publication, until it was independently duplicated by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns in the 1890s. Mendel’s laws are often reduced to the general statement “like begets like,” which became a frequent justification for eugenic practices.',

Charles Darwin expands on evolutionary theory in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex to directly follow the concepts introduced in On the Origin of Species. In this volume, he applies his theories to human evolution and discusses concepts related to human “races,” sexual differentiation and the relation of his evolutionary theory to human society. Most significantly, he discusses medical advances that allow “the weak” to reproduce, and cautions that reason (ie. disallowing their reproduction) should not replace sympathy. This book has entered the public domain and is available as an e-book here. More information about Darwin and his works, including full copies his publications, is available at The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online.',
