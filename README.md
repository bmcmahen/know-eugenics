know-eugenics
=============

The public website sponsored by the LAE to help people learn about eugenics. 

This website is made using Express.js (basically, something like Rails or Django) built on top of node. 

The templates are written using Jade (basically, a simplified HTML) and the css is written with Stylus (kinda like LESS which bootstrap twitter uses). It's easy to learn and makes the process of writting CSS and HTML much less painful. 

Dependencies:

Node.js
Express.js
